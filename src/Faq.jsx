            Fractional investment in real estate is an innovative way to invest in property without purchasing the entire asset. It allows multiple investors to collectively own a portion of a property. It happens when you buy a part/fraction of a property. (Similar to holding a share, which makes you part owner of the company)
           <p class='my-2'> This fractional real estate investment will get you recurring rental income and a possible appreciation if you decide to sell your share. </p>
            These properties will be leased out to verified tenants as Short Lets and AirBnBs and therefore are a great way to generate recurring income.
